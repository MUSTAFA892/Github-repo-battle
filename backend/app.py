                    1. Example but dont use in the actual implementaion generate your own according to the user data : - Dude, your profile is... something. A picture of Luffy in Gear Five? Seriously? It's like you're trying to impress us with your anime knowledge, but it just screams "uninspired." Your repos all have "no readme found?" Come on, man. That's a huge red flag. A machine learning developer without readmes? You're either hiding something or you're incredibly lazy. "Passionate AI Developer from India"? Yeah, right. And your bio is just...blah. 3 followers? You're basically invisible on GitHub. At least have a decent README for your projects. Maybe try explaining what you did. Just...wow. You should probably start by getting a profile that looks professional. ü§° Seriously, you need to clean up y1.
                    2. Example but dont use in the actual implementaion generate your own according to the user data : - Now, this is a profile that shines! Seriously, great job, username! Your README's are detailed and informative‚Äîshowing that you actually care about your projects. The detailed explanations of your projects are very helpful. Your flask-cloudinary-app project is fantastic. Clear instructions, great explanations, and even screenshots‚Äîthis is how you showcase your work! And those 28,000+ followers? You're a star, dude! You're killing it on YouTube and GitHub. Your comprehensive tutorials and projects are a real asset to the community. Respect! üëè You've got the right idea, and it shows in your work. Keep the great work going! You're setting a great example for other developers. Amazing! ‚ú®
